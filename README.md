## Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This program is able to take user input and help with scheduling and organizing a persons work-day. Colors of each time block change based on the time of day. Grey means the hour has passed, green means that is the present hour, and red means that hour has yet to happen. The current date and time displays on the top of the page so the user knows what day it is. Any events the user enters into each time block and saves will persist on the page even after a page refresh.
